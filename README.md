# User Management Backend System Documentation 
  
 This documentation provides an overview and step-by-step guide on creating a User Management Backend System using Express.js and MongoDB. The system allows performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data stored in a MongoDB database. The backend is implemented using Express.js, a popular Node.js framework for building web applications, and MongoDB, a NoSQL database. 

   ## Prerequisites 
  
 Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed: 
  
 1. Node.js - version 12 or above 
 2. npm (Node Package Manager) - usually bundled with Node.js installation 
 3. MongoDB - ensure it is installed and running on your local machine or have access to a MongoDB instance

 ## Setting Up the Project 
  
 Follow these steps to set up the project: 
  
 1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it using the command line. 
  
 2. Initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command: 
  
    bash 
    npm init -y 
     
  
 3. Install the required dependencies: Express, Mongoose, and any additional packages you may need. Run the following command: 
  
    bash 
    npm install express mongoose

## Creating the Express Server 
  
 1. Create a new file named `server.js` in the project directory. 
  
 2. Import the required packages at the top of the file.
 3. Create an instance of the Express application.
4. Set up the middleware to parse JSON data: 
  
    javascript 
    app.use(express.json()); 
     
  
 5. Connect to the MongoDB database: 
  
    javascript 
    mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/user_management', { 
      useNewUrlParser: true, 
      useUnifiedTopology: true, 
    }); 
     
  
    Replace `mongodb://localhost/user_management` with the appropriate MongoDB connection string for your setup. 
  
 6. Start the Express server: 
  
    javascript 
    const port = 3000; 
  
    app.listen(port, () => { 
      console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`); 
    }); 
 ## Defining the User Model 
  
 1. Create a new directory named `models` in the project directory. 
  
 2. Inside the `models` directory, create a new file named `User.js`. 
  
 3. Define the User schema and model using Mongoose.
 ## Implementing CRUD Operations 
  
 1. Create a new directory named `routes` in the project directory. 
  
 2. Inside the `routes` directory, create a new file named `users.js`. 
  ## Testing the API Endpoints 
  
 You can now test the CRUD operations using an API testing tool like Postman or cURL. Here are some example requests: 
  
 - *Create a user* - Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/users` with the following JSON data in the request body: 
  
   json 
   { 
     "name": "John Doe", 
     "email": "john@example.com", 
     "age": 30 
   } 
    
  
 - *Get all users* - Send a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/users`. 
  
 - *Get a specific user by ID* - Send a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/users/:id`, where `:id` is the ID of the user you want to retrieve. 
  
 - *Update a user* - Send a PUT request to `http://localhost:3000/users/:id` with the updated JSON data in the request body. 
  
 - *Delete a user* - Send a DELETE request to `http://localhost:3000/users/:id`, where `:id` is the ID of the user you want to delete.
